## Requirements

**All models**

- [ ] start with `Fmp`
- [ ] are implemented as Java 16+ records
- [ ] implement the `FmpModel` interface
- [ ] have `serialVersionUID`
- [ ] have test: `is_serializable`
- [ ] have test: `serializes`
- [ ] use date time classes for dates, instead of strings, where appropriate
- [ ] use value objects, instead of strings, where appropriate
- [ ] have `*TestData` in `testFixtures`

**All services**

- [ ] use the model name + `Service` suffix
- [ ] are added to the appropriate FmpClient
- [ ] have tests with real responses from FMP
- [ ] with responses stored as JSON in `testFixtures` (*for large responses, include only an excerpt*)

**General**

- [ ] aim for 100% test coverage; TDD is preferred
- [ ] double-check your work before creating a PR
- [ ] refactor unrelated code in a separate PR from feature or bugfix changes (don’t refactor "as you go")
- [ ] adhere to the existing code style
